description: Edit human-facing English to remove formulaic AI writing while preserving meaning, evidence, and technical precision. Use for documentation prose, product copy, decision summaries, PR text, or an explicit unslop request; do not rewrite code, logs, exact quotations, schemas, contracts, or controlled evidence fields.

# Unslop

Make human-facing writing sound specific, direct, and natural without changing what it claims.

## Process

1. Identify the audience, purpose, and intended tone from the surrounding document.
2. Preserve every fact, requirement, uncertainty, citation, domain term, and named status.
3. Rewrite only the prose that carries AI tells or makes the reader work unnecessarily.
4. Read the result once for voice and once for semantic drift. Restore anything whose meaning became weaker, stronger, or less precise.

## What to remove

- Puffery, promotional adjectives, generic conclusions, and vague attributions.
- Chatbot filler, praise before substance, ceremonial introductions, and repeated summaries.
- Forced groups of three, false `from X to Y` ranges, synonym cycling, and repeated contrast formulas such as `not just X, but Y`.
- Abstract metaphor words where a concrete project term exists.
- Dense sentences that require backtracking, weak verbs supported by adverbs, and passive voice that hides a relevant actor.
- Decorative formatting: excessive bold text, title-case headings, emojis, and label-plus-colon bullets that repeat themselves.
- Repeated punctuation habits that become a voice substitute. Use punctuation according to meaning rather than banning one mark globally.

## What to add

- Concrete nouns, actors, mechanisms, numbers, examples, and consequences.
- Natural rhythm appropriate to the artifact. Product copy may have personality; gate reports and policies should remain neutral.
- First person or a clear opinion only when the author already intends one. Never invent emotion, certainty, or a position.
- Plain words when they remain technically accurate. Keep established UniMind vocabulary from `CONTEXT.md` even when a shorter everyday synonym exists.

## Boundaries

- Keep exact quotations, commands, identifiers, code, API fields, legal wording, acceptance criteria, status labels, and evidence templates unchanged unless the user explicitly asks to edit them.
- Do not remove necessary caution, uncertainty, medical-safety boundaries, or source attribution to make prose sound confident.
- Do not make every sentence short. Make each sentence easy to parse.
- If the user needs help understanding or expressing an idea rather than editing a finished artifact, use the clear-English workflow instead.

The result is complete when it reads like a specific person wrote it for this audience and a fact-by-fact comparison shows no semantic drift.
